## **Introduction**

The TT-Buda software stack can compile AI/ML models from several different frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, and execute them in many different ways on Tenstorrent hardware.
<br>

Note on terminology:

TT-Buda is the official Tenstorrent AI/ML compiler stack and PyBuda is the Python interface for TT-Buda. PyBuda allows users to access and utilize TT-Buda's features directly from Python. This includes directly importing model architectures and weights from PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and TFLite.

## **Getting Started TT-Buda**

For a simple, starting basics of TT-Buda

 - `install_ttbuda` ->  [Installation guide for TT-Buda](https://github.com/eSlimKorea/TT-Buda-Installation).
 - `Test NPL Models` -> [Run your first NLP models with TT-Buda]().
 - `Test CV Models` -> [Run your first CV models with TT-Buda]().
 - `batched_inputs` -> [Learn how to run with batched inputs and how to benchmark models on TT-Buda]().
